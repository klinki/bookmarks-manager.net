# bookmarks-manager.net
Main goal of this project is to have some universal and useful bookmarks manager.
I find bookmarks managers in pretty much all current browser almost completely useless 
(with bright exception of Firefox which has quite nice bookmark manager).

This project should solve following issues:
- Importing bookmarks from bunch of different browsers (I currently focus on Chrome and Firefox)
- Usable user interface for managing bookmarks
   - allow sorting by name, url, added date, last visited date, count of visits (if available)
   - support tags
   - search
   - Drag & Drop UI
- add some more advanced features
   - identify possible duplicates
   - some UI to easily remove duplicates
   - group bookmarks by server
